# ros heartbeat

## what is this?
create subscriber that listens to 'cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop' as the user drives the turtleboet.

## why?
learn ros by creating nodes, topics, and all that other good stuff.

## run

1) fetch listener script
```
git clone https://github.com/mynameisvinn/ROS-Turtlebot-Listener
cd catkin_ws
catkin_make # need to use cmake even for python nodes
```
(more information on pub/sub)[http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29]

2) run turtlebot

from terminal 1, do
```
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
```
from terminal 2, do
```
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
```

3) execute listener

from terminal 3, do
```
cd catkin_ws
source ./devel/setup.bash
rosrun ros_heartbeat listener.py
```
theres no need to do $ roscore because "roslaunch turtlebot" launches a roscore. to see how the python listener was modified, go to https://github.com/mynameisvinn/ROS-Turtlebot-Listener/blob/master/src/beginner_tutorials/scripts/listener.py

## faqs

### create ros workspace and package
* http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace
* http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/CreatingPackage

### create publisher/subscriber
* http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29

### finding nodes
`rosnode list #list active nodes`
`rosnode info /key_teleop #examine topics/services for a specific node eg key_teleop`

### tell me about my topics
* show topics `rostopic list`
* examine nodes subscribed/publishing to that node `rostopic info /cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop`
* manually publish to topics `rostopic pub -r10 /hello std_msgs/String "hello"`
